This is a Linux userspace system software programmimg utility. Programmers can easily compile them into a static library and use provided APIs in their project.

## How to use:

Git clone this repository

	# git clone https://github.com/w180112/libutil.git

Type

	# cd libutil

Type make to compile

	# make

Then you can find there is a static library in the same directory.

To remove the binary files

	# make clean
